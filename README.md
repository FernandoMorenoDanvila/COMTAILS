# COMTAILS: COMet dust TAIL Simulator
### This FORTRAN code is created by **Fernando Moreno**, of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, CSIC, Granada, Spain.
### It is desgined to generate synthetic dust tail images from comets and active asteroids.
### It is easily compiled with GNU free compiler gfortran on Linux stations. FITSIO and PGPLOT libraries must be installed on the system.
### A manual describing the input files, compilation instructions, and example executions can be found in file COMTAILS.pdf. 
### ALWAYS CHECK THE INPUT # Rec (with the JPL-Horizons system) IN FILE TAIL_INPUTS.dat, AS IT MAY CHANGE EVENTUALLY FOR THE DESIRED TARGET
### The code is described in Moreno (2025), see https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05291, paper accepted by A&A
