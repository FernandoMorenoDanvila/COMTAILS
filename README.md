# COMTAILS: COMet dust TAIL Simulator
### This algorithm is created by **Fernando Moreno**, of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía, CSIC, Granada, Spain.
### It is desgined to generate synthetic dust tail images from comets and active asteroids.
### At this moment, a FORTRAN serial version (see branch FORTRAN_SERIAL), and a parallel MPI FORTRAN version (in branch FORTRAN_PARALLEL) are available, as well as   
a parallel PYTHON version at https://github.com/FernandoMorenoDanvila/py_COMTAILS.
### A manual describing the input files, compilation instructions, and example executions can be found in file Manual_COMTAILS.pdf. 
##  IMPORTANT: ALWAYS CHECK THE INPUT # Rec (with the JPL-Horizons system) IN FILE TAIL_INPUTS.dat, AS IT MAY CHANGE EVENTUALLY FOR THE DESIRED TARGET
### The code is described in Moreno (2025), A&A, 695, 263.
### Updated versions will be uploaded regularly. Please visit this platform for updates.
